This tutorials guides you to go straight into interacting with MySQL database using Ruby alone. No Rails.
It is assumed that MySQL has been installed in your computer.

Now let's get started:

First of all, lets begin with installing MySQL libraries via RubyGems

``` ruby
	sudo gem install mysql
```
There is [documentation](http://www.tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby/) for the MySQL library online . So you can follow that.

Now let's fire irb.

``` ruby
	require 'mysql'
	db = Mysql.new('localhost', 'user', 'password', 'database')

```

<!-- more -->
If you are using something like Lampp you may end up with error like

``` ruby
	Mysql::Error: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
```
So you have to locate where your mysqld.sock is.

For Lamp users, it's in
/opt/lampp/var/mysql/mysql.sock
For others you can find by using
ps aux | grep mysql

Next,create symlink at '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' to location of mysql.sock by ln -s command.

``` ruby

	sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/var/mysql/mysql.sock /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

```

That's it. Now we are ready to go.
With successfull connection we can query to database.

``` ruby

	begin
	  results = db.query "SELECT * FROM users"
	  puts "Number of users #{results.num_rows}"
	  results.each_hash do |row|
	    puts "User #{row.id}: #{row.name}"
	  end
	  results.free
	ensure
	  db.close
	end

```

The code is wrapped up in an exception handling block, to ensure that no matter what happens in the code. The database connection is closed.

The returned result is of Mysql::Result class.Check the [documentation](http://www.tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby/) and scroll down to Mysql::Result for various methods available at your disposal.If you are familiar with other MySQL connectors, this should be a breeze.

Lastly, Mysql Ruby connector also supports prepared statements, so you can use goodness out of it.

``` ruby

	begin
		insert_new_user = db.prepare "INSERT INTO users (name, age, gender) VALUES (?, ? ,?)"
		insert_new_user.execute 'travis', '22', 'male'

		insert_new_user.close

		statement = db.prepare "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?"
		statement.execute 'travis'
		statement.fetch
		statement.close
	ensure
		db.close
	end

```
