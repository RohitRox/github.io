JavaScript has strong object-oriented programming capabilities, even though some debates have taken place due to the differences in object-oriented JavaScript compared to other languages.
## Objects and Classes

JavaScript is a prototype-based language which contains no class statement, such as is found in C++ or Ruby. This is sometimes confusing for programmers accustomed to languages with a class statement. Instead, JavaScript uses functions as classes. Defining a class is as easy as defining a function. In the example below we define a new class called Person.
``` javascript
	function Person() { }
```
To create a new instance of an object new operator.
``` javascript
	my_person = new Person();
```
<!-- more -->
## Constructors

Every action declared in the class gets executed at the time of instantiation which can act like the constructor, used to set the object's properties or to call methods to prepare the object for use.
``` javascript
	function Person(first_name, last_name) {
		this.first_name = first_name;
		this.last_name = last_name;
		this.full_name = this.first_name + this.last_name;
		console.log(this.full_name + ' is instantiated.');
	}

```

## Methods

``` javascript
	// adding sayHello method to Person
	Person.prototype.sayHello = function()
	{
	  alert ('Hello '+ this.full_name);
	};
```
## Private and Public

Common issue in JavaScript is that there is no true sense of private variables. However, we can use closures to somewhat simulate privacy.
``` javascript

	function Person(first_name, last_name) {

		var balance = 0.0;
		// balance is private and cannot be accessed from outside

		addBalance = function () {
			balance += 10;
		};
		// addBalance is private and cannot be accessed from outside

		this.first_name = first_name;
		this.last_name = last_name;
		this.full_name = this.first_name + this.last_name;
		// first_name, last_name, full_name  are public variables

		console.log(this.full_name + ' is instantiated.');

		this.viewBalance = function(){ alert(balance); }
		// viewBalance is public
	}

```
## Literal version fo creating Objects and defining Methods and Properties
``` javascript
	// Constructor version
	function myObject(){
	    this.iAm = 'an object';
	    this.whatAmI = function(){
	        alert('I am ' + this.iAm);
	    };
	};

	// Literal version
	var myObject = {
	    iAm : 'an object',
	    whatAmI : function(){
	        alert('I am ' + this.iAm);
	    }
	}
```
Literal is a preferred option for name spacing so that your JavaScript
code doesn’t interfere (or vice versa) with other scripts running on the
page and also if you are using this object as a single object and not requiring
more than one instance of the object, whereas Constructor function type
notation is preferred if you need to do some initial work before the object
is created or require multiple instances of the object where each instance
can be changed during the lifetime of the script.


For a literally notated object, you simply use it by referencing its variable name,whereas with constructor functions you need to instantiate (create a new instance of) the object first.
